## Job {#Job}

Job represents the configuration of a single job.



- **apiVersion**: batch/v1


- **kind**: Job


- **metadata** (}}">ObjectMeta)

  Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

- **spec** (}}">JobSpec)

  Specification of the desired behavior of a job. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status

- **status** (}}">JobStatus)

  Current status of a job. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status





## JobSpec {#JobSpec}

JobSpec describes how the job execution will look like.





### Replicas


- **template** (}}">PodTemplateSpec), required

  Describes the pod that will be created when executing a job. The only allowed template.spec.restartPolicy values are "Never" or "OnFailure". More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/

- **parallelism** (int32)

  Specifies the maximum desired number of pods the job should run at any given time. The actual number of pods running in steady state will be less than this number when ((.spec.completions - .status.successful) \}}">LabelSelector)

  A label query over pods that should match the pod count. Normally, the system sets this field for you. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors

- **manualSelector** (boolean)

  manualSelector controls generation of pod labels and pod selectors. Leave `manualSelector` unset unless you are certain what you are doing. When false or unset, the system pick labels unique to this job and appends those labels to the pod template.  When true, the user is responsible for picking unique labels and specifying the selector.  Failure to pick a unique label may cause this and other jobs to not function correctly.  However, You may see `manualSelector=true` in jobs that were created with the old `extensions/v1beta1` API. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/#specifying-your-own-pod-selector

### Beta level


- **podFailurePolicy** (PodFailurePolicy)

  Specifies the policy of handling failed pods. In particular, it allows to specify the set of actions and conditions which need to be satisfied to take the associated action. If empty, the default behaviour applies - the counter of failed pods, represented by the jobs's .status.failed field, is incremented and it is checked against the backoffLimit. This field cannot be used in combination with restartPolicy=OnFailure.
  
  This field is beta-level. It can be used when the `JobPodFailurePolicy` feature gate is enabled (enabled by default).

  
  *PodFailurePolicy describes how failed pods influence the backoffLimit.*

  - **podFailurePolicy.rules** ([]PodFailurePolicyRule), required

    *Atomic: will be replaced during a merge*
    
    A list of pod failure policy rules. The rules are evaluated in order. Once a rule matches a Pod failure, the remaining of the rules are ignored. When no rule matches the Pod failure, the default handling applies - the counter of pod failures is incremented and it is checked against the backoffLimit. At most 20 elements are allowed.

    
    *PodFailurePolicyRule describes how a pod failure is handled when the requirements are met. One of onExitCodes and onPodConditions, but not both, can be used in each rule.*

    - **podFailurePolicy.rules.action** (string), required

      Specifies the action taken on a pod failure when the requirements are satisfied. Possible values are:
      
      - FailJob: indicates that the pod's job is marked as Failed and all
        running pods are terminated.
      - FailIndex: indicates that the pod's index is marked as Failed and will
        not be restarted.
        This value is alpha-level. It can be used when the
        `JobBackoffLimitPerIndex` feature gate is enabled (disabled by default).
      - Ignore: indicates that the counter towards the .backoffLimit is not
        incremented and a replacement pod is created.
      - Count: indicates that the pod is handled in the default way - the
        counter towards the .backoffLimit is incremented.
      Additional values are considered to be added in the future. Clients should react to an unknown action by skipping the rule.

    - **podFailurePolicy.rules.onPodConditions** ([]PodFailurePolicyOnPodConditionsPattern), required

      *Atomic: will be replaced during a merge*
      
      Represents the requirement on the pod conditions. The requirement is represented as a list of pod condition patterns. The requirement is satisfied if at least one pattern matches an actual pod condition. At most 20 elements are allowed.

      
      *PodFailurePolicyOnPodConditionsPattern describes a pattern for matching an actual pod condition type.*

      - **podFailurePolicy.rules.onPodConditions.status** (string), required

        Specifies the required Pod condition status. To match a pod condition it is required that the specified status equals the pod condition status. Defaults to True.

      - **podFailurePolicy.rules.onPodConditions.type** (string), required

        Specifies the required Pod condition type. To match a pod condition it is required that specified type equals the pod condition type.

    - **podFailurePolicy.rules.onExitCodes** (PodFailurePolicyOnExitCodesRequirement)

      Represents the requirement on the container exit codes.

      
      *PodFailurePolicyOnExitCodesRequirement describes the requirement for handling a failed pod based on its container exit codes. In particular, it lookups the .state.terminated.exitCode for each app container and init container status, represented by the .status.containerStatuses and .status.initContainerStatuses fields in the Pod status, respectively. Containers completed with success (exit code 0) are excluded from the requirement check.*

      - **podFailurePolicy.rules.onExitCodes.operator** (string), required

        Represents the relationship between the container exit code(s) and the specified values. Containers completed with success (exit code 0) are excluded from the requirement check. Possible values are:
        
        - In: the requirement is satisfied if at least one container exit code
          (might be multiple if there are multiple containers not restricted
          by the 'containerName' field) is in the set of specified values.
        - NotIn: the requirement is satisfied if at least one container exit code
          (might be multiple if there are multiple containers not restricted
          by the 'containerName' field) is not in the set of specified values.
        Additional values are considered to be added in the future. Clients should react to an unknown operator by assuming the requirement is not satisfied.

      - **podFailurePolicy.rules.onExitCodes.values** ([]int32), required

        *Set: unique values will be kept during a merge*
        
        Specifies the set of values. Each returned container exit code (might be multiple in case of multiple containers) is checked against this set of values with respect to the operator. The list of values must be ordered and must not contain duplicates. Value '0' cannot be used for the In operator. At least one element is required. At most 255 elements are allowed.

      - **podFailurePolicy.rules.onExitCodes.containerName** (string)

        Restricts the check for exit codes to the container with the specified name. When null, the rule applies to all containers. When specified, it should match one the container or initContainer names in the pod template.

### Alpha level


- **backoffLimitPerIndex** (int32)

  Specifies the limit for the number of retries within an index before marking this index as failed. When enabled the number of failures per index is kept in the pod's batch.kubernetes.io/job-index-failure-count annotation. It can only be set when Job's completionMode=Indexed, and the Pod's restart policy is Never. The field is immutable. This field is alpha-level. It can be used when the `JobBackoffLimitPerIndex` feature gate is enabled (disabled by default).

- **maxFailedIndexes** (int32)

  Specifies the maximal number of failed indexes before marking the Job as failed, when backoffLimitPerIndex is set. Once the number of failed indexes exceeds this number the entire Job is marked as Failed and its execution is terminated. When left as null the job continues execution of all of its indexes and is marked with the `Complete` Job condition. It can only be specified when backoffLimitPerIndex is set. It can be null or up to completions. It is required and must be less than or equal to 10^4 when is completions greater than 10^5. This field is alpha-level. It can be used when the `JobBackoffLimitPerIndex` feature gate is enabled (disabled by default).

- **podReplacementPolicy** (string)

  podReplacementPolicy specifies when to create replacement Pods. Possible values are: - TerminatingOrFailed means that we recreate pods
    when they are terminating (has a metadata.deletionTimestamp) or failed.
  - Failed means to wait until a previously created Pod is fully terminated (has phase
    Failed or Succeeded) before creating a replacement Pod.
  
  When using podFailurePolicy, Failed is the the only allowed value. TerminatingOrFailed and Failed are allowed values when podFailurePolicy is not in use. This is an alpha field. Enable JobPodReplacementPolicy to be able to use this field.



## JobStatus {#JobStatus}

JobStatus represents the current state of a Job.



- **startTime** (Time)

  Represents time when the job controller started processing a job. When a Job is created in the suspended state, this field is not set until the first time it is resumed. This field is reset every time a Job is resumed from suspension. It is represented in RFC3339 form and is in UTC.

  
  *Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.*

- **completionTime** (Time)

  Represents time when the job was completed. It is not guaranteed to be set in happens-before order across separate operations. It is represented in RFC3339 form and is in UTC. The completion time is only set when the job finishes successfully.

  
  *Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.*

- **active** (int32)

  The number of pending and running pods.

- **failed** (int32)

  The number of pods which reached phase Failed.

- **succeeded** (int32)

  The number of pods which reached phase Succeeded.

- **completedIndexes** (string)

  completedIndexes holds the completed indexes when .spec.completionMode = "Indexed" in a text format. The indexes are represented as decimal integers separated by commas. The numbers are listed in increasing order. Three or more consecutive numbers are compressed and represented by the first and last element of the series, separated by a hyphen. For example, if the completed indexes are 1, 3, 4, 5 and 7, they are represented as "1,3-5,7".

- **conditions** ([]JobCondition)

  *Patch strategy: merge on key `type`*
  
  *Atomic: will be replaced during a merge*
  
  The latest available observations of an object's current state. When a Job fails, one of the conditions will have type "Failed" and status true. When a Job is suspended, one of the conditions will have type "Suspended" and status true; when the Job is resumed, the status of this condition will become false. When a Job is completed, one of the conditions will have type "Complete" and status true. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/

  
  *JobCondition describes current state of a job.*

  - **conditions.status** (string), required

    Status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown.

  - **conditions.type** (string), required

    Type of job condition, Complete or Failed.

  - **conditions.lastProbeTime** (Time)

    Last time the condition was checked.

    
    *Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.*

  - **conditions.lastTransitionTime** (Time)

    Last time the condition transit from one status to another.

    
    *Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.*

  - **conditions.message** (string)

    Human readable message indicating details about last transition.

  - **conditions.reason** (string)

    (brief) reason for the condition's last transition.

- **uncountedTerminatedPods** (UncountedTerminatedPods)

  uncountedTerminatedPods holds the UIDs of Pods that have terminated but the job controller hasn't yet accounted for in the status counters.
  
  The job controller creates pods with a finalizer. When a pod terminates (succeeded or failed), the controller does three steps to account for it in the job status:
  
  1. Add the pod UID to the arrays in this field. 2. Remove the pod finalizer. 3. Remove the pod UID from the arrays while increasing the corresponding
      counter.
  
  Old jobs might not be tracked using this field, in which case the field remains null.

  
  *UncountedTerminatedPods holds UIDs of Pods that have terminated but haven't been accounted in Job status counters.*

  - **uncountedTerminatedPods.failed** ([]string)

    *Set: unique values will be kept during a merge*
    
    failed holds UIDs of failed Pods.

  - **uncountedTerminatedPods.succeeded** ([]string)

    *Set: unique values will be kept during a merge*
    
    succeeded holds UIDs of succeeded Pods.



### Beta level


- **ready** (int32)

  The number of pods which have a Ready condition.
  
  This field is beta-level. The job controller populates the field when the feature gate JobReadyPods is enabled (enabled by default).

### Alpha level


- **failedIndexes** (string)

  FailedIndexes holds the failed indexes when backoffLimitPerIndex=true. The indexes are represented in the text format analogous as for the `completedIndexes` field, ie. they are kept as decimal integers separated by commas. The numbers are listed in increasing order. Three or more consecutive numbers are compressed and represented by the first and last element of the series, separated by a hyphen. For example, if the failed indexes are 1, 3, 4, 5 and 7, they are represented as "1,3-5,7". This field is alpha-level. It can be used when the `JobBackoffLimitPerIndex` feature gate is enabled (disabled by default).

- **terminating** (int32)

  The number of pods which are terminating (in phase Pending or Running and have a deletionTimestamp).
  
  This field is alpha-level. The job controller populates the field when the feature gate JobPodReplacementPolicy is enabled (disabled by default).
