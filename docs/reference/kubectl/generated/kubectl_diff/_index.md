## {{% heading "synopsis" %}}


Diff configurations specified by file name or stdin between the current online configuration, and the configuration as it would be if applied.

 The output is always YAML.

 KUBECTL_EXTERNAL_DIFF environment variable can be used to select your own diff command. Users can use external commands with params too, example: KUBECTL_EXTERNAL_DIFF="colordiff -N -u"

 By default, the "diff" command available in your path will be run with the "-u" (unified diff) and "-N" (treat absent files as empty) options.

 Exit status: 0 No differences were found. 1 Differences were found. &gt;1 Kubectl or diff failed with an error.

 Note: KUBECTL_EXTERNAL_DIFF, if used, is expected to follow that convention.

```
kubectl diff -f FILENAME
```

```
  # Diff resources included in pod.json
  kubectl diff -f pod.json
  
  # Diff file read from stdin
  cat service.yaml | kubectl diff -f -
```
