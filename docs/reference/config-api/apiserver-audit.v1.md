## `Event`     {#audit-k8s-io-v1-Event}
    

**Appears in:**

apiVersionstringaudit.k8s.io/v1
kindstringEvent
    
  
level [Required]
Level


   AuditLevel at which event was generated


auditID [Required]
k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/types.UID


   Unique audit ID, generated for each request.


stage [Required]
Stage


   Stage of the request handling when this event instance was generated.


requestURI [Required]
string


   RequestURI is the request URI as sent by the client to a server.


verb [Required]
string


   Verb is the kubernetes verb associated with the request.
For non-resource requests, this is the lower-cased HTTP method.

authentication/v1.UserInfo


   Authenticated user information.


impersonatedUser
authentication/v1.UserInfo


   Impersonated user information.


sourceIPs
[]string


   Source IPs, from where the request originated and intermediate proxies.
The source IPs are listed from (in order):

X-Forwarded-For request header IPs
X-Real-Ip header, if not present in the X-Forwarded-For list
The remote address for the connection, if it doesn't match the last
IP in the list up to here (X-Forwarded-For or X-Real-Ip).
Note: All but the last IP can be arbitrarily set by the client.



userAgent
string


   UserAgent records the user agent string reported by the client.
Note that the UserAgent is provided by the client, and must not be trusted.


objectRef
ObjectReference


   Object reference this request is targeted at.
Does not apply for List-type requests, or non-resource requests.


responseStatus
meta/v1.Status


   The response status, populated even when the ResponseObject is not a Status type.
For successful responses, this will only include the Code and StatusSuccess.
For non-status type error responses, this will be auto-populated with the error Message.


requestObject
k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime.Unknown


   API object from the request, in JSON format. The RequestObject is recorded as-is in the request
(possibly re-encoded as JSON), prior to version conversion, defaulting, admission or
merging. It is an external versioned object type, and may not be a valid object on its own.
Omitted for non-resource requests.  Only logged at Request Level and higher.


responseObject
k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime.Unknown


   API object returned in the response, in JSON. The ResponseObject is recorded after conversion
to the external type, and serialized as JSON.  Omitted for non-resource requests.  Only logged
at Response Level.


requestReceivedTimestamp
meta/v1.MicroTime


   Time the request reached the apiserver.


stageTimestamp
meta/v1.MicroTime


   Time the request reached current audit stage.


annotations
map[string]string


   Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with an audit event that may be set by
plugins invoked in the request serving chain, including authentication, authorization and
admission plugins. Note that these annotations are for the audit event, and do not correspond
to the metadata.annotations of the submitted object. Keys should uniquely identify the informing
component to avoid name collisions (e.g. podsecuritypolicy.admission.k8s.io/policy). Values
should be short. Annotations are included in the Metadata level.

FieldDescription

    
apiVersionstringaudit.k8s.io/v1
kindstringPolicy
    
  
metadata
meta/v1.ObjectMeta


   ObjectMeta is included for interoperability with API infrastructure.
Refer to the Kubernetes API documentation for the fields of the metadata field.

rules [Required]
[]PolicyRule


   Rules specify the audit Level a request should be recorded at.
A request may match multiple rules, in which case the FIRST matching rule is used.
The default audit level is None, but can be overridden by a catch-all rule at the end of the list.
PolicyRules are strictly ordered.


omitStages
[]Stage


   OmitStages is a list of stages for which no events are created. Note that this can also
be specified per rule in which case the union of both are omitted.


omitManagedFields
bool


   OmitManagedFields indicates whether to omit the managed fields of the request
and response bodies from being written to the API audit log.
This is used as a global default - a value of 'true' will omit the managed fileds,
otherwise the managed fields will be included in the API audit log.
Note that this can also be specified per rule in which case the value specified
in a rule will override the global default.





## `PolicyList`     {#audit-k8s-io-v1-PolicyList}
    


PolicyList is a list of audit Policies.

If wildcard is present, the validation rule will ensure resources do not
overlap with each other.

resourceNames
[]string


   ResourceNames is a list of resource instance names that the policy matches.
Using this field requires Resources to be specified.

users
[]string


   The users (by authenticated user name) this rule applies to.

omitManagedFields
bool


   OmitManagedFields indicates whether to omit the managed fields of the request
and response bodies from being written to the API audit log.

a value of 'true' will drop the managed fields from the API audit log
a value of 'false' indicates that the managed fileds should be included
in the API audit log
Note that the value, if specified, in this rule will override the global default
If a value is not specified then the global default specified in
Policy.OmitManagedFields will stand.
