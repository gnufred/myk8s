Upload the kubeadm ClusterConfiguration to a ConfigMap

### Synopsis


Upload the kubeadm ClusterConfiguration to a ConfigMap called kubeadm-config in the kube-system namespace. This enables correct configuration of system components and a seamless user experience when upgrading.

Alternatively, you can use kubeadm config.

```
kubeadm init phase upload-config kubeadm [flags]
```

### Examples

```
  # upload the configuration of your cluster
  kubeadm init phase upload-config --config=myConfig.yaml
```

### Options

   







--config string


Path to a kubeadm configuration file.



--cri-socket string


Path to the CRI socket to connect. If empty kubeadm will try to auto-detect this value; use this option only if you have more than one CRI installed or if you have non-standard CRI socket.



--dry-run


Don't apply any changes; just output what would be done.



-h, --help


help for kubeadm



--kubeconfig string&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Default: "/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf"


The kubeconfig file to use when talking to the cluster. If the flag is not set, a set of standard locations can be searched for an existing kubeconfig file.







### Options inherited from parent commands

   







--rootfs string


[EXPERIMENTAL] The path to the 'real' host root filesystem.
